"Undo Redo" Feature works with next steps:

    1. After every interaction with the sketchpad event is saved in unprocessedActions list, with helper method - markEvent.

    2. For the next step, it is important to transform events saved into unprocessedActions list into seperate actions. 
       With the help of eventIntoActions method, triggered by 'mouseup' event.
        
        1. Each event on sketchpad is 'mousedown' or either 'mouseover'. We can use this information to split 
           actions into seperate parts. When the event type is 'mousedown' new list is created into actionsStack list, 
           where all continuous 'mouseover' events are added.

        2. After the process, unprocessedActions list is cleared, to prevent repetitions in actionsStack list.
    
    3. When user clicks undo or redo buttons, all the necessary parts are ready for the feature to work, handleUndoRedo 
       method is triggered which does the main action of removing and adding actions from the actionsStack, and then calls executeUndoRedo method.
    
    4. executeUndoRedo method is used to draw the squares according to the data stored in callStack.
       
       1. At first the sketchpad is returned to its initial condition, it is cleared and the squares are filled.

       2. We take the squares from the callStack and search for them in html document, with the help of their unique id.

       3. We take square background colors from the callStack and assign them to the squares which are in html document.
    
    5. If there's new interaction with sketchpad, redoActionsStack is cleared to prevent unnecessary redo actions.

    6. On the press of clearpad, all stacks are cleared.
